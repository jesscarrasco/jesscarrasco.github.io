<post description="Cosine similarity" extended="Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors by measuring the cosine of the angle between them.

FOXP2 is a member of the large FOX family of transcription factors. Information from known human mutations and mouse studies suggest that FOXP2 regulates genes involved in the development of tissues such as brain, lung, and gut. In addition, FOXP2 is implicated in the development of language skills." hash="f07bd94f5270753811050c35767983e5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP2" private="no" shared="yes" tag="[wikipedia_article] genetics evolution linguistics biology language brain" time="2009-11-12T00:25:03Z"/>

The Tree of Life then represents the phylogeny of organisms, i. e., the history of organismal lineages as they change through time.

It is misleading then to talk of thinking as of a 'mental activity'. We may say that thinking is essentially the activity of operating with signs. This activity is performed by the hand, when we think by writing; by the mouth and larynx, when we think by speaking; and if we think by imagining signs or pictures, I can give you no agent that thinks. If then you say that in such cases the mind thinks, I would only draw attention to the fact you are using a metaphor, that here the mind is an agent in a different sense from that in which the hand can be said to be the agent in writing. If again we talk about the locality where thinking takes place we have a right to say that this locality is the paper on which we write or the mouth which speaks. And if we talk of the head or the brain as the locality of thought, this is using the 'locality of thinking' in a different sense." hash="a5166bf291b034b493b77fe9a18d64ff" href="http://ludwig_wittgenstein/" private="no" shared="yes" tag="[quote] brain psychology philosophy language narrative poetry" time="2009-08-11T23:44:25Z"/>

<post description="Streaming Classroom Interactions" extended=""The dataset consists of repeated observations of social interactions in over 150 high school classrooms during the 1996-97 school-year (McFarland 2001; McFarland and Bender-deMoll 2004; Moody, McFarland and Bender-deMoll 2005). Below, we depict the interaction from one of these class periods in a network movie using 2.5 minute time slices (average tie value in each), a .5 minute delta, and multi-component Kamada-Kawai layout process. As such, there is a sliding window of 2.5 minutes of interaction always being shown. We select this time-window because it is wide enough to capture enough of the interaction to represent fluid patterns or network forms (not just sequential dyads), and narrow enough so as to not merge a variety of interaction routines together, thereby confounding meaningful configurations." source: http://www.stanford.edu/group/sonia/examples/McFarlaClass.html" hash="f5c6df7cd724af97578ce54f2194e04b" href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/sonia/exampleMovies/cls33_10_16_96.mov" private="no" shared="yes" tag="[video] network graph kinetics social_network visualization animation emergence filetype:mov media:video" time="2009-05-19T11:05:25Z"/>

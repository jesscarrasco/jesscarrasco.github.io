Evidence from morphological, biochemical, and gene sequence data suggests that all organisms on Earth are genetically related, and the genealogical relationships of living things can be represented by a vast evolutionary tree, the Tree of Life. The Tree of Life then represents the phylogeny of organisms, i. e., the history of organismal lineages as they change through time. It implies that different species arise from previous forms via descent, and that all organisms, from the smallest microbe to the largest plants and vertebrates, are connected by the passage of genes along the branches of the phylogenetic tree that links all of Life","tags":["biology","genetics","history","evolution","tree","science","bioinformatics"],"link":"http://tolweb.org/tree/learn/concepts/whatisphylogeny.html","date":"2009-10-11T18:45:02.000Z","binNumber":36,"x":-42.03,"y":3.67},{"title":"50-years-exploration-big.jpg 1024×452 píxeles","description":"all space missions","tags":["[image]","space","astronomy","visualization","!","technology","history","filetype:jpg","media:image"],"link":"http://www.stevey.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/50-years-exploration-big.jpg","date":"2009-10-11T13:47:11.000Z","binNumber":52,"x":-32.77,"y":1.43},{"title":"Fifty Years of Exploration","description":"map of all missions sent from earth","tags":["[project]","visualization","map","space","astronomy","history","technology"],"link":"http://books.nationalgeographic.com/map/map-day/index","date":"2009-10-11T13:45:05.000Z","binNumber":52,"x":-36.48,"y":3.65},{"title":"Nikon Small World - Gallery","description":"The Nikon International Small World Competition first began in 1974 as a means to recognize and applaud the efforts of those involved with photography through the light microscope.

Below, we depict the interaction from one of these class periods in a network movie using 2.5 minute time slices (average tie value in each), a .5 minute delta, and multi-component Kamada-Kawai layout process. As such, there is a sliding window of 2.5 minutes of interaction always being shown. We select this time-window because it is wide enough to capture enough of the interaction to represent fluid patterns or network forms (not just sequential dyads), and narrow enough so as to not merge a variety of interaction routines together, thereby confounding meaningful configurations.","tags":["[video]","network","graph","kinetics","social_network","visualization","animation","emergence","filetype:mov","media:video"],"link":"http://www.stanford.edu/group/sonia/exampleMovies/cls33_10_16_96.mov","date":"2009-05-19T11:05:25.000Z","binNumber":69,"x":33.33,"y":-30.59},{"title":"lrg literary organism poste 600×849 pixels","description":"'The structure of Part One of On the Road visualised using a simple tree structure that has been worked with manually in order to give it a more organic feel.

Each branch of the tree is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-branches. A leaf node's rectangle has an area proportional to a specified dimension on the data. Often the leaf nodes are colored to show a separate dimension of the data. When the color and size dimensions are correlated in some way with the tree structure, one can often easily see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways, such as if a certain color is particularly relevant. A second advantage of treemaps is that, by construction, they make efficient use of space. As a result, they can legibly display thousands of items on the screen simultaneously.","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","visualization","image","2D","tree","graph"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemap","date":"2008-09-26T09:54:43.000Z","binNumber":64,"x":44.42,"y":-14.58},{"title":"HyperbolicTree","description":"","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","visualization","tree","circle","geometry","2D","information","graph","network","image","interface"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperbolicTree","date":"2008-09-26T09:53:54.000Z","binNumber":70,"x":31.15,"y":-25.43},{"title":"Imagination","description":"","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","image","psychology","brain","education","games","philosophy","language","narrative","life"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination","date":"2008-09-26T09:49:15.000Z","binNumber":46,"x":-27.83,"y":-8.32},{"title":"Visual thinking","description":"","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","image","shape","psychology","visualization","brain","education","patterns","language","design","neuroscience"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_thinking","date":"2008-09-26T09:48:03.000Z","binNumber":45,"x":-8.11,"y":21.95},{"title":"Visualization (computer graphics)","description":"","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","visualization","code","tool","image","algorithm","information"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_(computer_graphics)","date":"2008-09-26T09:45:21.000Z","binNumber":22,"x":-37.95,"y":-23.57},{"title":"Scientific visualization","description":"","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","information","visualization","image","science","shape","geometry"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_visualization","date":"2008-09-26T09:43:51.000Z","binNumber":4,"x":-48.41,"y":3.47},{"title":"Information graphics","description":"","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","information","image","visualization","design"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_graphics","date":"2008-09-26T09:40:27.000Z","binNumber":1,"x":12.87,"y":-43.11},{"title":"Creative visualization","description":"","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","visualization","psychology","image","life"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Visualization","date":"2008-09-26T09:38:50.000Z","binNumber":32,"x":43.08,"y":22.66},{"title":"Thought experiment","description":"Gedankenexperiment","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","brain","logic","language","psychology","science","physics","simulation"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment","date":"2008-09-26T09:36:57.000Z","binNumber":44,"x":-43.04,"y":9.33},{"title":"Gestalten - Books Detail: Data Flow","description":"","tags":["[book]","visualization","design","image","color","bestiario"],"link":"http://www.gestalten.com/books/detail?id=ceaea7651adf9ba0011b78b89b9d0295","date":"2008-09-26T09:35:16.000Z","binNumber":1,"x":4.88,"y":-47.84},{"title":"Metalanguage","description":"","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","language","linguistics","logic","loop"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalanguage","date":"2008-09-26T09:31:07.000Z","binNumber":8,"x":-27.4,"y":39.02},{"title":"Gödel, Escher, Bach","description":"libro de Douglas Hofstadter","tags":["[book]","[wikipedia_article]","code","complexity","loop","music","logic","math","education","cognition","language","numbers","escher","bach"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel,_Escher,_Bach","date":"2008-09-26T09:30:11.000Z","binNumber":61,"x":-3.81,"y":13.67},{"title":"Jose","description":"My favorite website ever","tags":["humor","banality","popular","html"],"link":"http://www.tkk.fi/Units/ChemEng/news/2003/aiche2003/bravo/index.html","date":"2008-09-25T19:01:35.000Z","binNumber":8,"x":-26.2,"y":38.49},{"title":"piratesarecool4","description":"","tags":["[image]","statistics","2D","image","math","humor"],"link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/borkweb/139092366/","date":"2008-09-25T18:02:02.000Z","binNumber":12,"x":-40.14,"y":23.08},{"title":"Color temperature","description":"","tags":["[wikipedia_article]","color","temperature","visualization","light"],"link":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature","date":"2008-09-25T17:03:54.000Z","binNumber":5,"x":-4.07,"y":-34.9},{"title":"The IBM glass engine","description":"The IBM Glass Engine enables deep navigation of the music of Philip Glass.
